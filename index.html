        <h2>About the Farm</h2>
        <p>
          Our family has been on this farm since 1937. This was a dairy farm,
          with rolling hills and woodlands for pasture. In the early 1960's my
          father was injured and we sold the dairy cows. We continued with beef
          cows and sheep until 1983 when all livestock was sold off the farm.
          This winter I will write about some of my memories on the farm. My
          father's name was Wesley Johansen. We named our portion of the farm to
          honor him and my mother for instilling in me the rural values that
          make me the person I am. I believe those values are anchored deep in
          my soul and fuel the desire my wife and I have to be good stewards of
          the land here.

          These timbers were used as the frame of the dairy barn on the farm. We
          saved them when we razed the barn several years ago. The barn was
          built in 1906 and had wood pegs to hold the timbers together.
